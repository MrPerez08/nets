congratulations, you finally got the stupid node onclick function working.
Your next step is to make the node move idc how you do it in the future man.


Make the transition from menu toggle more natural (when the menu is toggled, the node selected is centered, when closed it just eases a translation with the same distance as teh menu div as it moves away)
Add ability to scroll
Add a grid? to make it easier to see scrolling
