congratulations, you finally got the stupid node onclick function working.
Your next step is to make the node move idc how you do it in the future man.

Add node physics (how to add simulation to renderer.js??)
Make the transition from menu toggle more natural (when the menu is toggled, the node selected is centered, when closed it just eases a translation with the same distance as teh menu div as it moves away)
Add ability to scroll
Add a grid? to make it easier to see scrolling




Delicious node animation math: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/2knrn17ad5





The menu container should be replicated for other nodes, there should just be a single menu with the data inside of it being the attributes to a node
so "node" objects with an example instance being "Aidan Perez" with attributes:
    First name
    Last name
    age
    address
    email
    




Eventually I want to recreate this program using: 
    Frontend: 
    Backend: Rust + Actix Web  (NOT WEB ASSEMBLY BTW)
